I worked with a team in school - NUS SSHSPH - for a course assessment to examine the association between propofol duration and the incidence of delirium in ARDS ICU Patients.

My role in the team was to conduct descriptive data analysis with histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and summary tables, utilising R.

My descriptive analysis result can be view directly in GitHub via "Descriptive-Analysis-Propofol-Delirium.md" in this folder.

And my Rmd code can be viewed via "Descriptive-Analysis-Propofol-Delirium.Rmd" in this folder as well.

The full course assessment repository can be accessed via, https://github.com/xuqianyi/SPH5104
