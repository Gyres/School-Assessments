# Study: Propofol and Delirium in ARDS ICU Patients

I worked with a team in school - NUS SSHSPH - for a course assessment to examine the association between propofol duration and the incidence of delirium in ARDS ICU Patients.

My role in the team was to conduct descriptive data analysis with histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and summary tables, utilising R.

The descriptive analysis output can be view in the file "Descriptive-Analysis-Propofol-Delirium.md".
