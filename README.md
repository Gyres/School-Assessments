## Projects
### Descriptive Analysis for Study: Propofol and Delirium in ARDS ICU Patients
**Folder:** `Propofol-Delirium-Study`

**Overview:**

This project is part of a larger study investigating the association between the duration of propofol infusion and the incidence of delirium in ICU patients suffering from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The analysis includes key variables related to the study and provides visualizations and statistical insights into factors influencing delirium risk.

**Objectives:**
- Determine the relationship between the duration of propofol use and delirium incidence.
- Assess whether other factors, such as age and ICU stay length, influence delirium rates.

**Instructions:**
- Navigate to the [Propofol-Delirium-Study](Propofol-Delirium-Study) folder.
- Follow the instructions in the project's README.
